                    With a baseline established, the potential for VR became more widely recognized, and more 
                    improvements were being made every other year.

                    Following the decline of the Sensorama, Heilig returned with another attempt in 1960, patenting the 
                    Telesphere Mask as the first head-mounted display (HMD). While this model came with stereoscopic 3D 
                    wide vision and stereo sound, motion-tracking was not available in headset form until the introduction 
                    of Headsight a year later. Created by Bryan and Comeau of the Philco Corporation, Headsight additionally 
                    featured built-in screens for the individual eyes and a head-tracking system that utilized a remote 
                    camera to track motion, though it was used more for military use over VR ventures.

                    The next big step for VR came in 1965, when computer scientist Ivan Sutherland published what 
                    he called the Ultimate Display. The premise of his Ultimate Display was to create a headset 
                    capable of replicating a reality indistinguishable from our own. This would be achieved not only 
                    by utilizing 3D sound and tactile sensations in real time, but also giving users the ability to 
                    interact with the virtual world as realistically as possible. In this way, the Ultimate Display 
                    became the blueprint for most following VR inventions.

                    With the Ultimate Display in circulation, inventors were eager to prove themselves. The most 
                    critical of these was perhaps The Sword of Damocles in 1968, created by Sutherland and his student 
                    Bob Sproull. This giant, ceiling-hanging contraption was the first to implement a computer rather 
                    than a camera, requiring the user to be strap in before use. While it was too heavy to reasonably 
                    mass produce, it was able to produce wire frame shapes with ease, a novelty at the time.

                    From there, Myron Krueger set the basis for VIDEOPLACE technology with a series of “artificial reality” 
                    experiences. Starting in 1969, these projects were developed primarily using video systems. This cumulated 
                    with the unveiling of Krueger’s VIDEOPLACE at the Milwaukee Art Center in 1975. As the first interactive 
                    VR platform, it used a variety of tech such as projectors, graphics, video displays and cameras to surround 
                    the user and generate silhouettes that copied their movements, even allowing these silhouettes to interact 
                    with one another virtually. VIDEOPLACE was unique in that it didn’t require any gloves or goggles.

                    Created using snapshots from a car driving in the city, Aspen Movie Map allowed users to explore Aspen City 
                    virtually. Made by MIT in 1977, it also used no headset and instill the dream of using VR to view far away 
                    locations. McDonnell-Douglas Corporation integrated this idea for military use with their VITAL Helmet in 
                    1979. Instead of a camera lens, the VR software would track the pilot’s eye movements to generate images.

                    The creation of the first wired gloves is attributed to Sandin and Defanti in 1982, who dubbed their 
                    creations ‘sayre gloves’. It incorporated gesture recognition into the realm of VR by converting finger 
                    movements into electrical signals. Similar technology was then developed by VPL Research, Inc., who also 
                    became the first to sell VR goggles and gloves in 1985.

                    Entering the realm of video games, Nintendo stepped into the fray of VR with the Virtual Boy Console in 1995, 
                    becoming the first portable console with 3D graphics. It was no commercial success, however, as user voiced 
                    dissatisfaction with the lack of software, color, and issues with comfort. It was discontinued and replaced 
                    with the VFX1 Headgear by Forte a year later.

                    2014 was the year that VR technology starting really taking off, with Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR for $2 
                    billion dollars. Suddenly several major brands starting taking action to have a hand in the new market, with 
                    Google releasing the Cardboard (stereoscopic viewer for smartphones), Sony announcing Project Morpheus 
                    (PS4 VR headset), and Samsung revealing the Samsung Gear VR (headset that directly worked in tandem with a 
                    Samsung Galaxy smartphone). From there, it was only a matter of time before more people jumped in…
